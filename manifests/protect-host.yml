# Create Network Policy for Nodes
# Let's create some policies for the kubernetes nodes. Host endpoints are non-namespaced. So in order to secure host endpoints we'll need to use Calico global network policies. In a similar fashion to how we created the default-app-policy for pods in the previous module which allowed DNS but default denied all other traffic, weâ€™ll create a default-node-policy that allows processes running in the host network namespace to connect to each other, but results in default-deny behavior for any other node connections.
